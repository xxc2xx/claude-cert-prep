## Block 1 — Foundations

### Model family

| Model ID | Tier | When to pick |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-7` | Most capable | Hard reasoning, synthesis, long-horizon agents, anything where quality dominates cost. 1M-context variant available. |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Balanced | Production workhorse — most app use cases, structured analysis, tool use. |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Fast & cheap | High-volume extraction, classification, simple summarization, latency-sensitive UX. |

**Exam trap:** know exact strings, including Haiku's `-20251001` date suffix.

### Messages API anatomy

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,                    # REQUIRED
    system="You are a code reviewer.",  # top-level, NOT in messages
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Review this diff: ..."},
    ],
    temperature=1.0,                    # default 1.0; 0.0 = near-deterministic
)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

**Top 5 traps:**
1. `system` is a **top-level field**, not a message with `role: "system"` (that's OpenAI).
2. `max_tokens` is **required** — no default.
3. Messages must **alternate** user/assistant. No two same-role in a row.
4. First message must be `user`. (You CAN end with `assistant` — that's **prefill**.)
5. `content` can be a string OR a list of content blocks (`text`, `image`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `document`, `thinking`).

### Response shape

```python
response.content                       # list of content blocks
response.content[0].text               # text block payload
response.stop_reason                   # "end_turn" | "max_tokens" | "stop_sequence" | "tool_use" | "pause_turn"
response.stop_sequence                 # which stop string matched (if any)
response.usage.input_tokens            # non-cached input
response.usage.cache_read_input_tokens # served from cache (~10% cost)
response.usage.cache_creation_input_tokens  # written to cache (~125% cost)
response.usage.output_tokens
response.model                         # echo
response.id
```

| stop_reason | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `end_turn` | Claude finished naturally | Done |
| `max_tokens` | Hit your output cap | Usually a bug — raise `max_tokens` |
| `stop_sequence` | Output emitted a string from `stop_sequences` | Check `response.stop_sequence` |
| `tool_use` | Claude wants to call a tool | Execute tool, return `tool_result`, loop |
| `pause_turn` | Long-running tool use paused | Resume with continuation |

### Streaming

```python
with client.messages.stream(model="claude-sonnet-4-6", max_tokens=1024,
                            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
    final = stream.get_final_message()  # full Message after stream completes
```

Raw stream events: `message_start`, `content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`, `content_block_stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`, plus `ping` keepalives.

### Sampling params quick ref

| Param | Range | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `temperature` | 0.0–1.0 | 0.0 = deterministic-ish; 1.0 = default; higher = more varied |
| `top_p` | 0.0–1.0 | Nucleus sampling. Use either temp OR top_p, not both. |
| `top_k` | int | Only sample from top-K tokens. Rarely needed. |
| `stop_sequences` | list[str] | Up to 4 strings that halt generation when emitted |
